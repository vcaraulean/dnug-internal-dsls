dnug-internal-dsls
==================

This repository contains the code from a short presentation I gave in March 2012 at Geneva .NET User Group.

I've talked about how internal dsls (Domain Specific Languages) implemented using a Fluent API can serve to a better separation of concerns, code maintainability and clarity.

How to look at the code:
 - Check out master branch. It contains an example of a domain entity, Customer.cs
 - Check out `using-attributes` branch. The code shows how different infrastructure and domain concerns are implemented using Attribute based configuration.
 - Check the `using-fluent-configurtion` branch. Same features are now configured using Fluent APIs.
